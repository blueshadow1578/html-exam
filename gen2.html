    <h1 class="generation">Generation 2</h1>
    <p>just short of a year later Gates did it again he emerged from his year of development with the new shiny iPod gen
        2, he released the second generation of the iPod this device focused on user friendliness. it implemented the
        capability to use windows to import music and also improved the mouse wheel to be more touch sensitive. it also
        upgraded the ram to a whopping 64Mb (the best at the time)
        and 10-20 Gb of onboard storage. The iPod classic was a piece of revolutionary music playing history. it was the
        first popular music player in the 20th century. it integrated a user-friendly interface and constantly changing
        technology like the gigabyte upgrades with each generation and the god tier ram (at the time) made a great
        experience for the user. they also created the best music integration process allowing all computers to
        integrate
        the music onto the iPod. the music quality was unprecedented you could hear the beat which would normally need
        high-quality speakers or high-quality headphones. the iPod dug apple out of the gutter and brought them to the
        spotlight. The iPod was a new standard in schools home and all around the globe. even if your idea was
        completely
        original and work much like sony's it didn't matter you have instantly branded "an off brand" and your amount of
        sales would pale in comparison to the now growing brand of apple. no one ever supperpased their monopoly in the
        music business they made millions and continued innovating until the iPhone. </p>
