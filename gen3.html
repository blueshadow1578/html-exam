    <h1 class="generation">Generation 3</h1>
    <p> like the many times, before everyone waited in anticipation for bill gates to announce his newest idea, his
        revolutionary announcements were anticipated for months on end till he finally stepped up with his newest and
        best
        product so far. The iPod 3 was the first real redesign of the iPod classic. before this, the iPod had a more
        clicky
        interface. now it is all touch interface. it also has huge upgrades in the area of the ram and the gigs also
        rased
        by 20 from the last generation. generation 3 also changed the major part of how the iPod had music uploaded to
        the
        iPod itself The
        iPod classic was a piece of revolutionary music playing history. it was the first popular music player in the
        20th
        century. it integrated a user-friendly interface and constantly changing technology like the gigabyte upgrades
        with
        each generation and the god tier ram (at the time) made a great experience for the user. they also created the
        best
        music integration process allowing all computers to integrate the music on to the iPod. the music quality was
        unprecedented you could hear the beat which would normally need high-quality speakers or high-quality
        headphones.
        the iPod dug apple out of the gutter and brought them to the spotlight. the iPod 3 also had the most initial
        sales
        on the iPod at the time. this allowed them to scale up the speed of the reliese of the four and five the demand
        for
        ipods were growing and so was the amount of ipods.
